### About

Basic expense tracker built with React utilizing various hooks such as useState, useContext, and useReducer. We created a global context provider and wrapped our components in it to easily access our transactions data. From there we can manipulate and read the data within in our various components. Our AppReducer component allows us to create various actions depending on what dispatches we send to it in our GlobalState component. This was a great refresher on using React's built in hooks features, and while a little challenging, I learned a lot.
